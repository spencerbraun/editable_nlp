Aratus took advantage of this incident , and began plotting against Cleomenes with King Antigonus III Doson of Macedon . Previously , in 227 BC , two ambassadors from Megalopolis were sent to Macedon to request help . Antigonus showed little interest at the time , and these efforts failed . Aratus wanted the Macedonian king to come to the Peloponnese and defeat Cleomenes , in return for control of Acrocorinth . This was not a sacrifice that the League was willing to make , however , and they declined to seek help from Macedon .
