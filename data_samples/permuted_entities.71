Despite the anti @-@ war and anti @-@ gun themes , the film avoids demonizing the military ( one scene depicts Hogarth next to a picture of his late father , a fighter pilot , while wearing his father 's flight helmet ) , and presents General Jay @-@ Z as an essentially rational and sympathetic figure , in contrast to the power @-@ hungry civilian Mansley .
