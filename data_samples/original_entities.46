These sweeping design changes pushed the release dates closer to the upcoming release of the Game Boy Advance ( GBA ) , the next system in the Game Boy line that is backward compatible with Game Boy Color games . The team considered adding special functionality to the game triggered only when played on a GBA , but was afraid that the additional development time required for the addition would cause the games to be released after the GBA . When the release date of the GBA was postponed , the team was able to incorporate GBA functionality and still release the games approximately a month before the GBA was released . Staggered releases were abandoned in favor of releasing the two games simultaneously . This made it easier for the team to test the interaction between the games and keep the style consistent . Each title was shipped on an 8 @-@ megabit ( 16 @-@ megabit in Europe ) cartridge . The music for the games was composed by two employees of the Japanese music and sound effect production company Pure Sound , credited under the pseudonyms " M @-@ Adachi " and " Kyopi " . Nintendo artist and series regular Yusuke Nakano designed the characters for the two titles , and incorporated previous creations from Ocarina of Time into Oracle of Seasons and characters from Majora 's Mask into Oracle of Ages .
