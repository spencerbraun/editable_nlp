Despite the events of the previous night the Australians still held the road , while D Company continued to occupy the former Chinese strongpoint on Hill 63 , even if it was isolated from the rest of the battalion . Yet B and C Companies were now precariously positioned in the paddy field to the east and west of the road respectively , and come daylight were exposed to the Chinese positions on the high ground . The same day Coad visited 3 RAR ; dissatisfied with the battalion 's dispositions and having now lost confidence in its commander , he relieved Walsh of his position , appointing the second @-@ in @-@ command , Major Bruce Ferguson , in his place . Walsh returned to his posting at US Eighth Army headquarters . Ferguson came forward to take command of the battalion . Ordering 3 RAR to dig @-@ in , he despatched a number of clearing patrols , while C Company advanced unopposed to a hill overlooking the road 2 @.@ 2 kilometres ( 1 @.@ 4 mi ) north @-@ east of D Company . Reaching the top the Australians observed the Chinese withdrawing northwards up the valley . Further east , the Chinese attacked US 19 RCT ; however , by the afternoon of 6 November it became apparent that the Chinese withdrawal around Pakchon was part of a general disengagement .
