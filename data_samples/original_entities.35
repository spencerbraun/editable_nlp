Other commentators have cautioned against the conclusion that The Oceanides is either an example of impressionism or somehow stylistically indebted to Debussy . Tawaststjerna , for example , believes that the piece 's " anchorage in the major @-@ minor harmony and the relatively sparing use of modal and whole @-@ tone formulae " indicates that the tone poem " belongs to the world of late romanticism " , the impressionistic character of its texture , harmonic vocabulary , and rhythmic patterns notwithstanding . Hurwitz has likewise criticized the " roaring cataract of nonsense in the Sibelius literature " about the influence of the French impressionists on the composer . " Similar musical problems often produce similar solutions " , Hurwitz notes . " In this case , any symphonic portrait of the ocean is bound to rely more on texture and color than on vocal melody , for the simple reason that the ocean is not a person and does not sing ... nor does it lend itself to ... [ an ] anthropomorphic approach ... " . Layton detects the presence of " normal Sibelian procedures and techniques " in The Oceanides , dismissing any serious debt to Debussy . " Its growth from the opening bars onward is profoundly organic " , Layton writes . " And its apparent independence from the rest of Sibelius 's work is manifest only at a superficial level " .
