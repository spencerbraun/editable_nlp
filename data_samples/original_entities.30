Taraborrelli was proven wrong , and , in 1990 , he considered writing her biography , but put the thought aside , thinking such a venture was premature . He pointed out that " most subjects need time for evolution and personal growths , before their stories are ripe enough to put on paper . Madonna was in an ambitious , self @-@ involved phase during which nothing mattered more to her than her career . " He picked up the writing again in 1994 , but felt the same way about her , and hoped the time would come when the singer would focus on her personal life , rather than her career . A personal evolution occurred in her life with the birth of daughter Lourdes in 1996 , and it was then that Taraborrelli sensed the time was ripe to begin writing her biography .
