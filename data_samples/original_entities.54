While Willaumez operated in the South Atlantic , the British squadrons under Strachan and Warren hunted for him hundreds of miles to the north . Warren 's squadron cruised the eastern Atlantic , monitoring the trade routes than ran along the coast of West Africa while Strachan focused on the western Atlantic , particularly the southern approaches to the Caribbean . Although neither was in a position to intercept Willaumez until he began the return journey north , Warren 's position afforded him the opportunity to watch for any French or allied vessels returning to Europe from the East . At 03 : 00 on 16 March 1806 , lookouts on HMS London reported sails to the northeast and Captain Sir Harry Burrard @-@ Neale ordered his ship in pursuit . Although no other ships in the squadron could see anything , Warren gave the order to follow London in case the sails proved to be French .
