Born Mary Morse Baker on a farm in Bow , New Hampshire , Eddy was the youngest of six children in a family of Protestant Congregationalists . Her father , Mark Baker , was a deeply religious man , although , according to one account , " Christianity to him was warfare against sin , not a religion of human brotherhood . " In common with most women at the time Eddy was given little formal education , but said she had read widely at home . From childhood she lived with protracted ill health , complaining of chronic indigestion and spinal inflammation , and according to biographers experiencing fainting spells . The literary critic Harold Bloom described her as " a kind of anthology of nineteenth @-@ century nervous ailments . "
