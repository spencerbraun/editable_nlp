The 7th Armoured Division spent the morning of 12 June attacking towards Tilly @-@ sur @-@ Seulles , according to its original orders and at 12 : 00 Erskine ordered Hinde to move the 22nd Armoured Brigade immediately through the gap . Soon afterwards , the 8th King 's Royal Irish Hussars , the divisional reconnaissance regiment , began to reconnoitre a route for the brigade and the rest of the division left Trungy at around 16 : 00 . Four hours later the main body was close to Livry after a 12 @-@ mile ( 19 km ) unopposed advance , the last 6 miles ( 9 @.@ 7 km ) of which was through German @-@ held territory . The leading Cromwell tanks of the 8th Hussars were destroyed by a Panzer @-@ Lehr Division Escort Company anti @-@ tank gun which held out for two hours.Hoping to mislead the Germans about the objective , on reaching the vicinity of la Mulotiere north of Livry , Hinde ordered a halt for the night and the 8th King 's Royal Irish and 11th ( Prince Albert 's Own ) hussars , the divisional armoured car regiment , reconnoitred the flanks . The 11th Hussars encountered no resistance on the right flank and gained touch with the 1st US Infantry Division near Caumont and on the left flank ; the 8th Hussars located elements of the Panzer @-@ Lehr Division less than 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) away .
