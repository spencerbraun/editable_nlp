Additional optical effects were provided by Visual Concept Engineering ( VCE ) , a small effects company headed by Peter Kuran ; Kuran had previously worked at ILM and left after finishing The Empire Strikes Back . VCE provided effects including phaser beams , the Enterprise reactor , additional sand on Ceti Alpha V , and an updated transporter effect . Meyer and the production staff were adamant about not using freeze frames for the transporter , as had been done in the original television series . Scenes were shot so that conversations would continue while characters were in mid @-@ transport , although much of the matte work VCE created was discarded when the production decided not to have as much action during transports .
