Jacobitism was revived by the unpopularity of the union . In 1708 James Francis Edward Stuart , the son of James VII , who became known as " The Old Pretender " , attempted an invasion with a French fleet carrying 6 @,@ 000 men , but the Royal Navy prevented it from landing troops . A more serious attempt occurred in 1715 , soon after the death of Anne and the accession of the first Hanoverian king , the eldest son of Sophie , as George I of Great Britain . This rising ( known as The ' Fifteen ) envisaged simultaneous uprisings in Wales , Devon , and Scotland . However , government arrests forestalled the southern ventures . In Scotland , John Erskine , Earl of Mar , nicknamed Bobbin ' John , raised the Jacobite clans but proved to be an indecisive leader and an incompetent soldier . Mar captured Perth , but let a smaller government force under the Duke of Argyll hold the Stirling plain . Part of Mar 's army joined up with risings in northern England and southern Scotland , and the Jacobites fought their way into England before being defeated at the Battle of Preston , surrendering on 14 November 1715 . The day before , Mar had failed to defeat Argyll at the Battle of Sheriffmuir . At this point , James belatedly landed in Scotland , but was advised that the cause was hopeless . He fled back to France . An attempted Jacobite invasion with Spanish assistance in 1719 met with little support from the clans and ended in defeat at the Battle of Glen Shiel .
