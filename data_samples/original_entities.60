The many hardships and emotional challenges that Abu Shabaki endured , from growing up fatherless amid the First World War to losing his only born son , influenced his gloomy poetry which conveys a strong sense of the presence of evil in the world and an effort to find an escape in love or in the innocence of childhood and nature . Elias ' often pessimistic writings evoked a concern for the body and its lust , greatly affected by Romantic works he had read during his youth which commended loneliness , sorrow , passion , pain and death and denounced the materialism and lewdness of city life . Christian tradition and imagery inspired and permeated much of Abu Shabaki 's work , which abounds in biblical images , mirroring the experiences of a Christian who felt deeply about the teachings of the Catholic Church .
