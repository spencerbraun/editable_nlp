Band members have resisted attempts to link the group and its music to Marxism . In a 1999 interview , Gane stated that " none of us are Marxists ... I 've never even read Marx . " Although Gane admitted that his partner 's lyrics touch on political topics , he argued that they do not cross the line into " sloganeering " . Sadier herself has mentioned that she has read very little Marx . In contrast , Cornelius Castoriadis , a radical political philosopher but strong critic of Marxism , has been mentioned as a marking influence in her thinking . Her side project 's name ( Monade ) and its first album 's title ( Socialisme ou Barbarie ) are also references to the work of Castoriadis .
