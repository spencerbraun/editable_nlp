At the start of the book , the shopkeeper discusses with Valentin " the great secret of human life " . They consist of three words , which Balzac renders in capital letters : VOULOIR ( " to will " ) , POUVOIR ( " to be able " ) , and SAVOIR ( " to know " ) . Will , he explains , consumes us ; power ( or , in one translation , " to have your will " ) destroys us ; and knowledge soothes us . These three concepts form the philosophical foundation of the novel .
