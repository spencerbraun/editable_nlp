I really wanted to sit down with Wale before I wrote the hook , because to me , it 's really lame when people send you tracks , and they 're like , ' All right , Gaga , throw your vocals on it . ' This is Wale 's record . It 's not my record . It 's one of those songs , one of those tracks and one of those videos that you can 't stop listening to .
