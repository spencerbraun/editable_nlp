" This Silence Is Mine " , the game 's second theme song , was specially written and sung by Onitsuka Chihiro . It was composed by Okabe . Okabe asked Chihiro to help with the song because he felt she would be the perfect singer to project the world and themes of Drakengard 3 . The intention was to make the song emotionally intense , but at the same time " cold " and " empty " . While writing the song , Chihiro was inspired by Zero 's presentation within the game . The original draft of the song was created in around five minutes , and Chihiro had to sing the song five times before Okabe was satisfied with her performance . The song debuted in the game 's trailer at the 2013 Tokyo Game Show .
