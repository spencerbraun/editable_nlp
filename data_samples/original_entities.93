While Brant was active in the Mohawk valley , Butler descended with a large mixed force and raided the Wyoming Valley of northern Pennsylvania in early July . This action complicated affairs , for the Senecas in Butler 's force were accused of massacring noncombatants , and a number of Patriot militia violated their parole not long afterward , participating in a reprisal expedition against Tioga . The lurid propaganda associated with the accusations against the Seneca in particular angered them , as did the destruction of Unadilla , Onaquaga , and Tioga . The Wyoming Valley attack , even though Brant was not present , fueled among his opponents the view of him as a particularly brutal opponent .
