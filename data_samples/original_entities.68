On June 29 , 2007 , IGF held its debut show with Lesnar defending the IWGP Heavyweight Championship against Kurt Angle in the main event . Angle defeated Lesnar to win the championship at the show with Angle going on to appear in the American Total Nonstop Action Wrestling ( TNA ) promotion with the physical title belt . TNA also referred to the title belt as the IWGP Heavyweight Championship in the same manner as the IGF , recognizing Angle as the official IWGP Heavyweight Champion . NJPW did not recognize Angle as the IWGP Heavyweight Champion , instead it viewed Angle as the second IWGP 3rd Belt Champion .
