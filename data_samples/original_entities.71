The film also deals with the concepts of nonviolence and individualism . When the Iron Giant sees a deer get killed by hunters , the Iron Giant notices two rifles discarded by the deer 's body . The Iron Giant 's eyes turn red showing hostility to any gun . It is repeated throughout the film , " Guns kill . " and " You 're not a gun . " Despite the anti @-@ war and anti @-@ gun themes , the film avoids demonizing the military ( one scene depicts Hogarth next to a picture of his late father , a fighter pilot , while wearing his father 's flight helmet ) , and presents General Rogard as an essentially rational and sympathetic figure , in contrast to the power @-@ hungry civilian Mansley . Hogarth 's message to the giant , " You are who you choose to be " , played a pivotal role in the film . In a deleted scene , the robot dreams of seeing many robots like it marching through a war zone on an alien world , suggesting that the robot was created to be a weapon in a long @-@ ago war .
