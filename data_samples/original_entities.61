The dish combines ingredients and culinary practices of several cultures , including French , Spanish , German , West African , and Choctaw . Gumbo may have been based on traditional West African or native dishes , or may be a derivation of the French dish bouillabaisse . It was first described in 1802 , and was listed in various cookbooks in the latter half of the 19th century . The dish gained more widespread popularity in the 1970s , after the United States Senate cafeteria added it to the menu in honor of Louisiana Senator Allen Ellender . The popularity of chef Paul Prudhomme in the 1980s spurred further interest in gumbo . The dish is the official cuisine of the state of Louisiana .
