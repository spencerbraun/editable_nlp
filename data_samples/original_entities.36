As traders sailed farther east , the voyages became longer and more expensivea Smaller enterprises were merged into larger ones . During the 1780s , Grigory Shelikhov began to stand out as one of the most important traders through the Shelikhov @-@ Golikov Company . In 1784 , Shelikhov founded the first permanent Russian settlement in North America , at Three Saints Bay on Kodiak Island . Shelikhov envisioned a continual extension of the Russian maritime fur trade , with trading posts being set up farther and farther along the coast all the way to California . He sought exclusive control of the trade , and in 1788 Empress Catherine II decided to grant his company a monopoly only over the area it already occupied . Other traders were free to compete elsewhere . Catherine 's decision was issued as the imperial ukase ( proclamation ) of September 28 , 1788 .
