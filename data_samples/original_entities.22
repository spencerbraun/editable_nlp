Most of the detailed design for the Merchant Navy class was undertaken by the drawing office at Brighton works , but some work was also undertaken by Ashford and Eastleigh . This division of responsibility was possibly due to Bulleid 's wish to restrict knowledge of the new class to a limited number of personnel . The design incorporated a number of novel features , compared to then @-@ current steam locomotive practice in Great Britain .
