Amfortas arrives , borne on a stretcher by Knights of the Grail . He calls out for Gawain , whose attempt at relieving the King 's pain had failed . He is told that Gawain has left again , seeking a better remedy . Raising himself somewhat , the King says going off without leave ( " Ohn ' Urlaub ? " ) is the sort of impulsiveness which led himself into Klingsor 's realm and to his downfall . He accepts the potion from Gurnemanz and tries to thank Kundry , but she answers abruptly that thanks will not help and urges him onward to his bath .
