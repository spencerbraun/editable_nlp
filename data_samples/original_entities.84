Outside their tree house , Finn and Jake snooze , while BMO ( Niki Yang ) and N.E.P.T.R. ( Andy Milonakis ) play out a spoof of Robin Hood and the Sheriff of Nottingham . The two break open Finn and Jake 's treasure room , pouring their massive stash of gold out into the yard , as well as the Ancient Psychic Tandem War Elephant ( Steve Agee ) . BMO talks Finn into spending the money at an expensive resort at Wildberry Kingdom . When they arrive in the town square , Jake unloads their treasure into the city 's fountain . A guard scolds them for this , but they bribe him with a few shillings and a crown , freeing them from the law . Chaos follows shortly after Jake uses wealth to control the residents . When they disrespect her authority , Wildberry Princess ( Maria Bamford ) orders Finn and Jake to be arrested and for their money to be seized and melted down . Her punishment is for them to be covered in the molten gold , but BMO and N.E.P.T.R. arrive just in time and save the two .
