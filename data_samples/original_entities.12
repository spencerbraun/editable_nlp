On May 31 , the remnants of Alma were situated along the coast of Belize as a 1004 mbar low pressure system . A broad upper @-@ level ridge was anchored over the Gulf of Honduras , which covered the entire region and maintained deep tropical moisture . Satellite imagery and a NOAA buoy reported sustained tropical storm @-@ force winds . Despite moving ashore , the system was named Tropical Storm Arthur about 45 mi ( 72 km ) north @-@ northwest of Belize City . In post @-@ analysis , it was determined that Arthur had developed more than 12 hours earlier , late on May 30 , and made landfall early on May 31 with 45 mph ( 75 km / h ) winds in northeastern Belize . While over land , Arthur maintained minimal tropical storm force winds , concentrated primarily over open waters to the east and northeast . Despite being over land for several hours , the storm maintained a fairly organized structure . The storm contained a large low @-@ level center , accompanied by convective banding , and was developing new convective cells . Initially , it was thought Arthur would continue generally westward due to a ridge to its north , and later re @-@ intensify in the Bay of Campeche .
