By the 1960s , improvements in computing technology and the early development of relatively cheaper mainframe computers , which would later be termed minicomputers , led to the loosening of restrictions regarding programming access to the computers . At the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ) , access to the TX @-@ 0 experimental computer was opened to students and employees of the university . This in turn led to the development of programs that in addition to highlighting the power of the computer also contained an entertainment aspect . The games created for the TX @-@ 0 by the small programming community at MIT included Tic @-@ Tac @-@ Toe , which used a light pen to play a simple game of noughts and crosses against the computer , and Mouse in the Maze , which let players set up a maze for a mouse to run through . When the Digital Equipment Corporation ( DEC ) PDP @-@ 1 computer was installed at MIT in 1961 , the community built a video game to showcase it 's abilities , Spacewar , which then became the first known video game to spread beyond a single computer installation as it was copied and recreated on other PDP @-@ 1 systems and later on other mainframe computers .
