In 1960 , Wanzlick and co @-@ workers conjectured that carbenes derived from dihydroimidazol @-@ 2 @-@ ylidene were produced by vacuum pyrolysis of the corresponding 2 @-@ trichloromethyl dihydroimidazole compounds with the loss of chloroform . They conjectured that the carbene existed in equilibrium with its dimer , a tetraaminoethylene derivative , the so @-@ called Wanzlick equilibrium . This conjecture was challenged by Lemal and co @-@ workers in 1964 , who presented evidence that the dimer did not dissociate ; and by Winberg in 1965 . However , subsequent experiments by Denk , Herrmann and others have confirmed this equilibrium , albeit in specific circumstances .
