The break @-@ up of the centralised Mughal empire by 1750 , led to the creation of numerous semi @-@ independent kingdoms ( all provinces of the former Mughal empire ) . Nawab Siraj ud @-@ Daulah was defeated by the British forces of Sir Robert Clive in the Battle of Plassey in 1757 . Thereafter the Nawab of Bengal became a " puppet ruler " depending on military support from British East India company to secure their throne . Siraj @-@ ud @-@ Daulah was replaced by Mir Jaffer . He was personally led to the throne by Robert Clive , after triumph of the British in the battle . He briefly tried to re @-@ assert his power by allying with the Dutch , but this plan was ended by the Battle of Chinsurah . After the defeat at Battle of Buxar and grant of the Diwani ( revenue collection ) of Bengal by the then Mughal Emperor Shah Alam II , to the British East India Company in August 1765 and the appointment of Warren Hastings by the East India Company as their first Governor General of Bengal in 1773 , the Nawabs authority became restricted . By 1773 , British East India company asserted much authority and formed the Bengal Presidency over areas ruled by the Nawabs i.e. the Bengal subah , along with some other regions and abolished the system of Dual Government . In 1793 ( during Nawab Mubarak ud @-@ Daulah 's reign ) , the Nizamat ( military power , civil and criminal justice ) was abolished , British East India company thus annexed this former Mughal province as part of their empire and took complete control of the region , and the Nawabs of Bengal became mere pensioners of the British East India Company . All the Diwan offices except the Diwan Ton were also abolished .
